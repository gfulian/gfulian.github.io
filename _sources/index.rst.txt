My research activity is focused on the theoretical investigation of the structure and crystal-chemical/minero-physic properties of both 
natural and synthetic minerals, ceramics and nano-crystalline materials. These materials show fundamental mechanical 
and surface properties that are interesting for specific applications. The research is carried out on both the bulk 
and surface properties by means of quantum-mechanical approaches at the atomic scale, in particular Density Functional Theory (DFT).
